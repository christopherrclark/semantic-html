# 01 Code Refactoring: semantic HTML and Alt attributes

## Assigment description

In this assignment our goal was to refactor non-descriptive div tags to more descriptive semantic elements and add alt attributes to a screen reader friendly text description of images.

## User Story

<!-- From original README text -->

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

<!-- From original README text -->

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
